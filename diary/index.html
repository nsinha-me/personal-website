<p>Hi, I am Nikhil Sinha. I was born on 14-Jan-1999.<br>
Date of starting this diary : 03-Mar-2023.</p>
<p>What you are reading is my entire life&rsquo;s journey. I am writing all this as a proof of my existence. My emotions, my feelings, my views, my ideas and my experiences. Existence needs witness, reality is related to mind. This is why, I want you to know - I existed. I was sad at this day, I was happy on that day. Anyone around the world can be aware of my existence, even after I die. Yes ofc, one day I will sure die, not sure when. Day by day people will forget me. But thanks to internet even 100 years after my death, someone can look into my existence. Someone, just like me.</p>

<h3 id="-13-apr-2023-thursday"># 13-Apr-2023 Thursday</h3>
<p>Finally <em>lavish</em> and I decided to go with <em>flask</em> and <em>sqlite</em> for the website. Did some <em>vim</em> and <em>zsh</em> configuration. Now the current <em>arch</em> install is becoming usable. Still I have to add many functions like screenshot, brigntness, volume, charging. <em>mama</em> bought property, came in afternoon and gave sweets.</p>
<h3 id="-12-apr-2023-wednesday"># 12-Apr-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Tired. Talked to <em>lavish</em> about webstite making. I have to learn time management. I have time, but it is not utilized properly. Told the story of <em>The Dropout</em> to <em>nii</em>.</p>
<h3 id="-11-apr-2023-tuesday"># 11-Apr-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Good day. Worked hard. I am skipping lunch from 2-3 days due to work. This is not good for health. Went to <em>mohansarai</em> in evening. <em>mama</em> and <em>nana</em> came in afternoon, but did not get time to meet them properly. At night, talked to <em>ravi</em> on call regarding college, youtube and future plans.<br>
Completed <em>The Dropout</em>. It was good, learnt many things. I was thinking of positive story, but it was story about a fraud. Valuable lessons were there.</p>
<h3 id="-10-apr-2023-monday"># 10-Apr-2023 Monday</h3>
<p>Woke up late. Learning how to manage people. How to get the work done. How to talk to them. When to be polite and when to be rude. I am enjoying it. <em>mama</em>(maternal uncle) came in evening to meet. I love <em>mama</em>. He is so good. I am thankful to god that he has given persons like <em>mama</em> in my life. Actually, I have 2 great people, one is my father and other is my <em>mama</em>. Both are good people and best in their profession. One advocate and the other doctor. So coooool.</p>
<h3 id="-09-apr-2023-sunday"># 09-Apr-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Was tired, so slept long. Watched vim tutorial and practiced it. Scolded <em>Patel</em> for doing wrong thing. Watched first episode of <em>The Dropout</em>. It was amazing. I can relate to it. It is motivating me. I have to do things quickly. I am becoming lazy. Also, there are lot of pending works that I have to complete.</p>
<h3 id="-08-apr-2023-saturday"># 08-Apr-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>Gave BARC exam. Timing was 10am-12pm. Paper was hard and there were many multiple select questions. 2 BARC people came to the exam center, was happy to see them. Sun was too hot, got burnt while returning back to home. Met <em>akash</em>. Discussed about college preference, stock market, business ideas, and quant companies. Talked to <em>lavish</em> about future plans. <em>Dinesh chacha</em>(uncle) had an accident. <em>Banaras</em> is not good for driving. Learnt some <em>vim</em>.</p>
<h3 id="-07-apr-2023-friday"># 07-Apr-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Did <em>xmodmap</em> setting, finally. Happy. It took so much time, but at the end it was worth it. Pushed the <em>xmodmap</em> and xinitrc to github. Filled the gate score in BARC application. I am dealing with real people and learning marketing. Waaooooooo. Happy. Had talk with <em>chota papa</em>(uncle) on call in the evening and he said he will come to meet me before I go to college. <em>pradeep</em> called, discussed about BARC and college and future plans. Called <em>lavish</em> to get basic guidance about tomorrow&rsquo;s BARC exam. Also, gave him warning that his time is over. Now he has to work for me. Otherwise I will hire someone else. Funny, haahaaaa ha ha. I have not studied anything from last 2 months. Going to flip my notes as fast as possible, then I will sleep. Algorithms and compilers are my favourite. All the best to me for tomorrow&rsquo;s exam.<br>
Hare Krishna.</p>
<h3 id="-06-apr-2023-thursday"># 06-Apr-2023 Thursday</h3>
<p>I am riding too much scooty, but what to do, work is work. Hands are paining due to it, and hands, arms and feets got tanned. Managing and learning how to take work from people. <em>Patel</em> called in evening. Went to meet <em>nana</em>(maternal grandfather). <em>mama</em>(maternal uncle) came after some time. I was sitting besides him, and while discussing some topics he put his hand on my shoulder. Waoooo. Happy-happy. At night, did some <em>xmodmap</em> testing. But it did not work. Will give 1-2 more try. Filled the IIT BHU form. Did not fill IIT Delhi form, thinking its waste of money.</p>
<h3 id="-05-apr-2023-wednesday"># 05-Apr-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Whole day I was out. Felt good. Managed people, interacted with them. Back pain was there. Was filling IIT BHU form, but the server was slow. Tired. <em>Vishal verma</em>(school friend) called for information about industrial training from <em>dlw</em>.<br>
This day of the last month, I blocked her from everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="-04-apr-2023-tuesday"># 04-Apr-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Busy day. Cleaned the office. Setup the computers there. Managed some people. Went to <em>assi ghat</em> with <em>prateek</em> at night. Going to sleep early.</p>
<h3 id="-03-apr-2023-monday"># 03-Apr-2023 Monday</h3>
<p>Filled the IIT Gandhinagar form. I am very slow in doing all these things. I check twice and sometimes thrice before submitting. Got injection work done for <em>dada-dadi</em>(grandparents). Talked to <em>Patel</em> on call. Happy.</p>
<h3 id="-02-apr-2023-sunday"># 02-Apr-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Busy day. Nothing special. Yesterday, listened to wonderful story told by <em>Manisha Jakhmola</em> mataji. It was story about a <em>bhakt</em> and his simpleness. I showed it to mother, father and <em>dadi</em>(grandmother). Everyone enjoyed it.</p>
<h3 id="-01-apr-2023-saturday"># 01-Apr-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p><em>Kamada Ekadashi</em> today. Enjoyed this <em>Ekadashi</em>. Don&rsquo;t know why, but I was happy today. Cleaned the room. Changed table setup. BARC admit card came. The exam centre is 22km away from home. I have to study for it. Did some more <em>bspwm</em> changes. Added notification in it. Happy today.<br>
Hare Krishna.</p>
<h3 id="-31-mar-2023-friday"># 31-Mar-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Watched many videos about colleges. Did some <em>bspwm</em> configuration. Took <em>dadi</em>(grandmother) to hospital. <em>Romee</em> did not come. Watched <em>The Dropout</em> for 2 mins. It is awesome. I think it will inspire me to do something in life. Yes, I want to become billionaire. I want to work hard.<br>
Searched about which phone will be right for me. I am not using phone at all. Just for 5-10 mins. I have to get new phone. Going to sleep early.</p>
<h3 id="-30-mar-2023-thursday"># 30-Mar-2023 Thursday</h3>
<p>Tired a lot. Need some good rest. Dropped <em>papa</em>(father) at station. Did some college research. Finally I have decided to take CS from NITs. I will fill the forms of IITs just to have options open for me. Saw some NIT MTech videos. I am becoming too lazy also.<br>
Did not see <em>romee</em> today. She was there with us from 2015. She was street dog, we just used to give her food and water. And sometimes space to sleep in rainy and winter days. She was not well from many days. From last 2 days she did not eat anything. Yesterday at night I gave her water and she drank some. She was there at back of the house. It was the last time we saw her. Tried to find her today. Searched every street nearby. She was not there. Sad. Who will bite me now? Who will run behind the scooty now? Sad. She was the best street dog. Best of the best. Wherever she is, krishna please take care of her. And if she is not there with us anymore, then please krishna give her good <em>yoni</em>. After this much pain, she deserves something good. Today is <em>Ram Navami</em>. Please krishna give her shelter under your feet. <em>Romee</em>. Now whom I will slap? Now with whom will I play? Ahhhhh, sad.<br>
Hare krishna hare krishna, krishna krishna hare hare,<br>
Hare rama hare rama, rama rama hare hare.</p>
<h3 id="-29-mar-2023-wednesday"># 29-Mar-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Boring day. Talked to many people on linkedin about the branch I should take. Confused which college to choose. Took <em>dadi</em>(grandmother) to hospital for blood test. Headache was also there. I am taking too much tension and also old memories are haunting me. How can someone play with someone? What wrong I did? Is this world filled with people like her? I thought she is different, but I was completely wrong. She is also like everyone. Fake and fraud. But no problem, <em>karma</em> will take care of everything. For her and for me too. Lets see what happens in future. I am happy because I am free now. I can do whatever I want. Sky is the limit, lets surpass that too.<br>
Didn&rsquo;t get time to watch <em>The Dropout</em>. Busy all day. I have to fill the colleges form fast. Today listened to new song <em>Kaun Disha Mein Leke Chala Re Batohiya</em> from movie <em>Nadiya Ke Paar</em>. It was good song.</p>
<h3 id="-28-mar-2023-tuesday"># 28-Mar-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Talked to <em>S. Maurya</em> on ig, and then on whatsapp about gate results, preparation and future plans. Completed the COAP details. Searched for colleges. Talked to <em>pradeep, lavish, akash, nii</em> about colleges. Sent some more connection requests on linkedin. <em>Gokul</em> from IITB told to keep BMT the last option. He suggested IEOR, GNR and CTARA branches. He rejected BMT due to research work it will involve and some companies don&rsquo;t allow BMT. He recommended IEOR because of technical work and interesting subjects but hard ones. Also, he told that IITB would be much better than mid NITs. Now, I am confused. I want to study CS and also get some time for my own things. I don&rsquo;t want to study side subjects. Neither do I have interest in AI/ML. I want low level system designs(as of now). After talking to <em>Gokul</em>, I am thinking of taking CS from NIT. Because I don&rsquo;t want to do research in something non-CS. I love biology, but doing research in it would be waste of time.<br>
Took <em>dadi</em>(grandmother) to hospital. I am listening to songs at high volume in earphones. This is not good. Headache was there. I have lot of pending work to do.<br>
Uninstalled <em>VSCodium</em>. Now i will use vim for all my work.</p>
<h3 id="-27-mar-2023-monday"># 27-Mar-2023 Monday</h3>
<p>Did some system tuning(wallpaper, permissions, ricing). Added firefox addons. Lost the 800+ bookmarks. Sad. I have to find its solution for something like this in future. <em>lavish</em> and <em>ravi</em> sent the scanned marksheet of mine. <em>abhay</em> has started sending me lots of memes on ig. He is now my meme friend. Haha haaa haaa.<br>
Downloaded one episode of <em>Modern Family</em>. Was hoping something hilarious but it was okayish for me. Then downloaded <em>The Dropout</em>. It is about startup. A girl who became the self made youngest billionaire in america. I am hoping this will not disappoint me. Probably this will be my last series of the year.<br>
<em>Gupta</em> posted photos of her and <em>paranjal</em> on ig. 4 years together and counting. Happy for them.</p>
<h3 id="-26-mar-2023-sunday"># 26-Mar-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Wasted too much time today. Watched memes on reddit for 2 hours. reddit has some of the best memes that are relatable and funny. Registered on COAP website. <em>mama</em>(maternal uncle) came in evening to see <em>dada</em>(grandfather). Talked to <em>lavish</em> in night about COAP and colleges. <em>Patel</em> shared screenshot of her close moment that she wrote in notepad. Happy for her.<br>
Used terminal today for everything. Happy. For copying, pasting, opening, installing, &hellip; for everything I used command line. It will make me good and fast. Also uploaded dotfiles to github. Learnt about symlinks. I have to clean my external hard-disks. One is 1 TB and other is 1.5 TB. Both are almost full. They contain many duplicate files.<br>
Headache is not there. I have to start some physical exercise. Urge to watch porn was high. But I controlled myself. Also, I am becoming too lazy. Fuck. I have exam in 2 weeks and have not studied anything in last 50-55 days.</p>
<h3 id="-25-mar-2023-saturday"># 25-Mar-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p><em>dadi</em>(grandmother) came to meet us. Wished <em>akash</em> birthday. Asked him about colleges. Talked to <em>pradeep</em>. I am happy with his decision. I am happy that I have friends like <em>pradeep</em> who are not coward. I don&rsquo;t know what will be its outcome, but the decision that <em>pradeep</em> took are the decisions taken by brave people. Happy and proud.<br>
At night went to <em>assi ghat</em> with <em>prateek</em>. Talked to foreigners for 1 hour. They were from <em>Germany</em>. They came to India 3 weeks ago. And banaras was their last destination. They will be returning to germany tomorrow. We talked on many topics like tech, indian culture, divorce, foods, banaras, business. At last took photos with them and exchanged contacts. Felt nice talking to them.</p>
<h3 id="-24-mar-2023-friday"># 24-Mar-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Woke up at 9am. That&rsquo;s some impressive progress. <em>dada</em>(grandfather) diagnosed with <em>Osteoporosis</em>. Ahhhhhh sad. Doctor prescribed daily &amp; weekly medicines and treatment will take 3 years and for temproary pain relief gave <em>diclofenac</em> injection. Old age is filled with so many problems. I am happy that <em>dada</em> is with me and I am doing something for him. Not everyone gets this opportunity. Checked the BARC website. Downloaded the gate scorecard. Edited my linkedin profile and sent some connection requests. Talked to <em>lavish</em> about colleges.<br>
Yesterday <em>pradeep</em> recommended <em>scrcpy</em> tool for screen mirroring. What an awesome piece of software it is. Just does what is says with tons of features. Single command and the phone&rsquo;s screen is available on the laptop in interactive mode. In starting I tested with usb cable, but now I am using it on wifi network. Replied to whatsapp&rsquo;s messages. Scrolled instagram. Atleast now I am able to use my phone. I can see my messages and otp&rsquo;s.<br>
Instagram is filled with useless people. Everyone is posting their adventurous trip photos. Some are going to national parks, some to goa, some to hill stations, some come to banaras. I don&rsquo;t have problem with trips. Trips and having fun with friends is good as they help in having good mental health. Neither do I have problem with people posting these photos on ig. The main problem is these newly employeed kids don&rsquo;t know the value of investing money. They are spending so much money in these trips. On hotels, on cool dresses, on nice foods, &hellip;. Sick people. These people will understand it later. These people are very very useless. On friday night, half of my ig stories is filled with their stories showing how low level mindset they have. A boy will be dancing on dance floor and the caption will be &ldquo;Ab corporate naukar 2 din ki chhutti enjoy karega&rdquo;(Now corporate servant will enjoy 2 days leave). What is this man? Dumb people.<br>
Also, now the country is divided into two parts. Girls like koreans and boys like russians. These big ig account people and ig memers have made russian word so slang. I hate it. Shame on these people. They are not understanding its consequences. India is viewed as a country that has values and culture. The world knows that Indians respect everyone. But when the whole world and specially russia will come to know that russian is slang word in India. What will they think of us then? Such a derogatory slang it is. It will destroy India&rsquo;s respectful image. These ig people are making fun and gaining followers and likes but they don&rsquo;t know its result. IG is cringe app filled with cringe people.</p>
<h3 id="-23-mar-2023-thursday"># 23-Mar-2023 Thursday</h3>
<p>Took <em>dada</em>(grandfather) to hospital. Talked to <em>pradeep</em> about the phone screen mirroring software and also discussed about the colleges. Went to <em>assi ghat</em> with <em>prateek</em> at night. Had fun. Its 1am, and I am going to sleep to fix my fucked up routine.<br>
Headache is almost gone. Sometimes its there, but its very mild. Finally I am happy. Happy-happy.<br>
I love these lines from the song <em>Tum Tak</em> (<em>Raanjhanaa</em>)-<br>
<em>nainon ke ghat le jaa, nainon kee naiya</em><br>
<em>patavaar too hai meri, too khivaiyaa</em><br>

<p>Went to sleep at 1pm. Woke up at 5pm. Fuck. What is this man? I will become sick if I don&rsquo;t correct my sleep schedule. Phone has almost become unusable. Only the top section where it shows time and network is visible, and rest of the display becomes blank. I am thinking of mirroring the phone screen to laptop using the usb cable. For the same called <em>pradeep</em> but he didn&rsquo;t picked the call. Wrote blog about how to install arch linux.<br>
Completed the <em>Farzi</em> webseries. It was average for me. Sexual content was negligible. Perfect. Too much abusive language. Not at all perfect. Why does webseries use so much abusive language? Also, I was hoping of some more <em>kaabiliyat</em>(intelligence) by the lead actor. I don&rsquo;t understand why the person who works hard gets divorced. Didn&rsquo;t the wife already knew that the husband would not be able to give time. Then why did she marry him. Just to give divorce? This is not correct. Why marry someone who is dedicated to his work and would not be able to give time? If you already know the situation and want to marry, then why give divorce? Just don&rsquo;t marry him, as simple as that. Am I waiting for season 2? No. Will I watch season 2? No. Why? Because, it was not of my type.<br>
When I was out at night, I saw someone falling from his bike. Went to him. He was badly drunk. Then I and one more person went to drop the drunk uncle to his house 2km away. Should have I left him there thinking that someone will come and help him? <em>maa</em>(mother) keeps telling me not to get into these situations. She tells me that helping everytime is not good because the society is bad. But I don&rsquo;t understand all this. The goodness inside me is alive. Maybe someday I will get in trouble by helping someone, then I will understand.<br>
Politics in my family is growing. <em>maa</em> is saying not to get into all this and focus on studies and job. But I think, I have to do something. They are playing their moves, and I am not doing anything because I really don&rsquo;t want to indulge in all these things. Lets see what happens.</p>
<h3 id="-21-mar-2023-tuesday"># 21-Mar-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Took the phone backup. Used phone for just 10-15 mins today because I can&rsquo;t even read text messages properly due to flickring screen. Again got wet in rain at night. Ahhhh, why it rains only when I go outside.<br>
Wiped <em>awesomewm</em> and installed <em>bspwm</em> on laptop. Happy. Now, I will document everything so that next time it will be easy for me. Also, I will upload the dot files to github.<br>
Downloaded <em>Farzi</em> webseries and watched 3 episodes. I have just watched 1 series in past 3 years and it was <em>Scam 1992</em>. I usually don&rsquo;t watch movies and series. I don&rsquo;t like their stories. I have watched <em>Mirzapur</em> part one, <em>Family Man</em> part one, but have not watched part two. Why? Because, its not my type.<br>
I have to setup my laptop quickly so that I can resume my work. Waking up all night is not good for me, because the urge to watch pornographic content are at its peak. I have to put lot of energy to control myself. I don&rsquo;t want to watch porn. Porn is for loosers. And I am not one of them.</p>

<p>Went to <em>realme</em> service centre. The phone is completely damaged. It will cost around 14,000 INR (display+motherboard+camera). Haahaahaa ha ha. Funny, because I can buy new phone in this much money. Its still in working condition, but the display is flickering and touch is also not working correctly. He told to backup data, because it can be dead anytime. I have to backup data asap then I will insert sim card and connect to wifi/data. Aahhhhhhhh, a small mistake costed me this much. Sad.<br>
Installed <em>bspwm</em> on desktop. Yesterday on laptop, I think I was doing something wrong with <em>sxhkd</em>. Finally happy today.<br>
Went to <em>assi ghat</em> with <em>prateek</em> at night. The weather was cold. Enjoyed for 2 hours. Returned at 11pm.<br>
Some observations: There is always a tradeoff between time and money in real life. You can go with train and save money but waste time OR you can go with flight and spend money but save time. You can go to govt. hospitals and stand in queue and waste time but save money OR you can go to private hospitals and save time but spend money. (Today) I wasted 4 hours in <em>realme</em> service centre just to come to conclusion that I don&rsquo;t want to do any upgrades because its costly OR I could just have bought new phone and save time but spend money.</p>
<h3 id="-19-mar-2023-sunday"># 19-Mar-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Total time waste today. Installed <em>bspwm</em>. Was happy. After reboot, it got stuck after the disk block check step. Wasted 7 hours to fix it. But no result. Finally at night clean wiped to <em>awesomewm</em>. I wasted whole day in this, but got to learn many new things. Now I have to install all the packages. And configure them individually. Ohhhhhhh, lot of work to do. This time I will write all the process in blogs and script some of them, so that next time I don&rsquo;t waste this much time. <em>mama</em> came in evening to see <em>dada</em>. Made coffee for him. He loves coffee made by me. Took feedbacks from friends about the type of content I should <strong>not</strong> post on ig.<br>
At night I was driving scooty , suddenly it started raining. I got wet. No problem. Hailstones were also falling. They were hitting me on my face, head and hands very hard. No problem. But, I had phone in my pocket. I should have kept it inside scooty. It got wet and now the display is damaged. Sad. I have to take it to service centre tomorrow. Displays are too costly. Sad.<br>
I had bookmarked more than 800 websites in <em>firefox</em> on laptop. I had to clean wipe to install <em>awesomewm</em> and sadly could not backup the bookmarks. I have taken the backup of <em>/boot</em> and <em>/home</em>. Now, I have to search where the <em>firefox</em> kept the bookmarks. I have to restore it somehow.</p>
<h3 id="-18-mar-2023-saturday"># 18-Mar-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>Fasting <em>(Papamochani Ekadashi)</em>. Talked to <em>nii</em> about colleges. <em>DTU</em> seems to be good option, lets see what i get. First rain of the year. Got wet too, intentionally. Took scooty, went on small ride in <em>dlw</em> and listening to <em>radha kripa kataksh</em> and soft rain drops falling on me. Happy-happy.<br>
Hare Krishna.</p>
<h3 id="-17-mar-2023-friday"># 17-Mar-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Searched about colleges based on my gate score. Went to meet <em>nana-nani</em>. <em>mama</em> was also there. Discussed with them about the gate result. <em>nana</em> gave blessings that I will get admission in college. I also hugged <em>nana</em>. It was amazing. I don&rsquo;t remember when I hugged him last time. Very happy. Even in his old age, <em>nana</em> is so cool.<br>
<em>pradeep</em> said about me that &ldquo;My experience with relationships has made me more strong. I am not able to see it, but after 3-4 years I will be more stronger than rest of the emotional peoples and be thankful that all these relationship bullshits happened with me.&rdquo; He told me to remember this. I am writing it here as a proof for the future me. Chatted with <em>rohit</em> bhaiya of <em>IPEC Mess</em> on ig. Felt good-good.</p>
<h3 id="-16-mar-2023-thursday"># 16-Mar-2023 Thursday</h3>
<p>Brought <em>dada</em> to <em>dlw</em> in morning. Slept for 2 hours in afternoon. Listened to <em>Vol 1</em> by <em>Honey Singh</em> in loop. This is not good. Listening to such derogatory songs once or twice for fun is okish but listening in loop is not at all good. It will destroy my taste for good songs. Also, it will pollute my subconscious mind slowly-slowly. Gate website got crashed due to heavy traffic. So instead of 4pm, the result came out around 10pm. Went to buy injection for <em>dada</em> (<em>Deca-Durabolin</em>). Night walk with <em>prateek</em> at <em>surya sarovar</em>. Saw gate result infront of him.<br>
Hmmmm, the result was neither good nor bad. It was what I deserved. But, after droping a year for preparation and the result comes out approx same as last year, sad. Was she responsible for all this? No. It was me who wasted my time, it was me who took the headache. How can someone waste my time, if i don&rsquo;t want. I am accountable for all this. Was time waste the only reason for my poor result? No. Split of energy in various directions, is my biggest problem. Whenever I prepare for something, I am not focused. I start doing things that are not so imp and could be done later. But my naughty mind. Ahhhhhh. I know what I am. I know how different I am form the rest of the crowd. I know my potential. The only thing required is focus. I have to concentrate on one thing. Spliting of time and brain power in many directions is not good. Lesson learnt: be happy yourself, don&rsquo;t give time and energy to anyone, and focus on only one thing.<br>
The <em>monika bansal</em> meme I made yesterday got some good views because of the shares it got. That means I have to create something that is relatable so that people share them. <em>pankaj</em> unfollowed me and <em>pradeep</em> both. Hahahaaahhaa ha ha. Funny. People don&rsquo;t know why I came to ig. They think that I came to ig like everyone comes, to follow and follow back and waste tons of time. But I have purpose.</p>
<h3 id="-15-mar-2023-wednesday"># 15-Mar-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Woke up at 3pm. Made 4 memes back to back. Got mixed reactions. My fav. was love marriage to arrange marriage meme, because it took some real effort in making it. Went to meet <em>choti maa</em>, had discussion about <em>dada-dadi</em>. Played with <em>syncthing</em> setting. Backed up some files using it. Looked at Imagemagick documentation, its vast. Gate result will be declared tomorrow. Also, to fix my sleeping schedule, I will not sleep today.</p>
<h3 id="-14-mar-2023-tuesday"># 14-Mar-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p><em>nana-nani and mami</em> came to meet us. Had fun with them. Got to learn many things from their experiences. Sent the blog link to my friends. Again <em>pradeep</em> was asking about whats the use of this blinking effect. How to explain him, I don&rsquo;t know. Not everything is done for the purpose of use. I did it because I found it interesting. And after making it I was happy-happy. <em>Bajpai</em> appreciated it. Had chit-chat with her. On some of her messages I reacted with heart emoji. She might think that I am simping. But I didn&rsquo;t. I generally don&rsquo;t react on messages, but lately using ig I have started reacting to messages and reels sent by heart emoji. And the same habbit reciprocated to whatsapp.<br>
Finally installed <em>syncthing</em> on my phone and laptop. I have to test its various settings to decide which one suits my use case. Then I will delete google photos. Fuck google.</p>
<h3 id="-13-mar-2023-monday"># 13-Mar-2023 Monday</h3>
<p>Went to <em>samneghat</em> to buy medicines. Wifi connection problem solved. Wrote blog about the flashing effect that I created 2 days ago. Created short tutorials about the telegram hacks and posted it on ig. Nobody responded, as usual. IG is cringe because it has cringe audience. Most of the people who use ig are dumb.<br>
Mental health is improving slowly-slowly. Headache is minimal. I am not getting time for meditation and exercise. My sleeping schedule is disturbed. Going to sleep at 6am and then waking up at 12 noon is not good. Sometimes I get scolded also. I need to fix this asap.</p>
<h3 id="-12-mar-2023-sunday"># 12-Mar-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Woke up in noon. Sleep cycle is pretty much fucked for sure. Went to meet dada-dadi (grandparents), as usual had verbal fight for the same old reason. I don&rsquo;t understand why they are doing like this. Their stubbornness will only harm them, and not the rest of the family. This is great learning for me. I don&rsquo;t know what I will do in my old age, but definitely sure that what my grandparents are doing, I will not do it.<br>
Asked my friends about the blinking gif I created yesterday, got most of the votes for 50fps, 1 for 18fps and 1 for 24fps. Personally, my vote goes for 24fps, because this is the sprit with which I created the gif. Also, the 50fps gif is slow blinking due to the fact that people are unable to comprehend it. So, its appearing as slow-slow.</p>
<h3 id="-11-mar-2023-saturday"># 11-Mar-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>I have started procrastinating a lot. Thats not good. Created two memes. One was normal, about CTC vs inhand. And the other was about BTS. But people reacted 6 times more on low effort meme about CTC in comparision to BTS meme. Was my BTS meme so normiee?? I made it for fun, and not to hurt someone. Also, the meme was not so dark. I&rsquo;m confused now. To grow in marketing and advertisement field, I need to know how people respond. I have to create more content to know how people react.<br>
Made blinking effect with the help of imagemagick and ffmpeg. Felt happy-happy, because it was something new I did and its rare in todays society what I did.<br>
Also, headache is subduing. But when it comes from time to time, its unbearable. Krishna, please help. You are <em>Sarva karanah karanam</em>. I know whats happening with me has some hidden cause. You and only you know the cause. Whatever you do is correct without any doubt. But krishna, please take away my headache. Please make me old nikhil, that used to be full of humour and joy and didn&rsquo;t have any headache. Please krishna.<br>
Hare Krishna.</p>

<p>Met many people today. Cousin and <em>mami</em> in the afternoon, neighbours in the evening, <em>bua</em>(paternal aunt) and <em>prateek</em> at night. Had discussion about feminism with neighbours. Also talked about jobs in tech industry with them. At night went to <em>Bhullanpur Station</em> with <em>prateek</em>.<br>
Bugs did face revel on yt today. What a fucking video to watch this morning, it was looking like he has RGB lighting system inside his body. Haa haa haahahahah. I know it was ffmpeg magic. He probably did this by constantly changing the colors by selecting some specific color from the present frame.</p>

<p>Lost days of nofap streak this morning. Sigh!! Lets make new nofap streak. This time I am more stronger. Added some notes to my website. Talked to <em>lavish</em> about gate counselling. Talked to <em>pradeep</em> about the same. But the talk went 2 hours long. Had some good discussion with him. <em>Patel</em> called to inform me that venus and jupiter are clearly visible. Went outside to watch, <em>Patel</em> was on the call. Happy to see the Venus aka the evening star, but sadly the jupiter was not visible. Switched to video call to show <em>Patel</em> how the Venus looked from my POV. Being a girl(and that&rsquo;s important here), she accepted the video call without any second thought. Walking back home, I was on video call with her. Had some 5-6 minutes talk. Then she told me to talk to her mother on video call. I felt shy, so told her not to do so. But alas!! Her mother was on video call and we excahged greetings. Then <em>Patel</em> showed me <em>aalu sabji</em> her mother was making. Watched some videos about Obsidian. I will be switching to Obsidian for notes making and managing my tasks.<br>
In this busy society, showing you care for someone can be a challenging task. I am completely aware of the fact that nowadays people are busy, they don&rsquo;t have time for anyone. But but but, who the fuck wants to eat someone&rsquo;s time. What people want is closeness. A small act can show the care and closeness between two people. This act can vary from time to time and person to person. By saying that &ldquo;I am busy, I don&rsquo;t have time,&hellip;.&rdquo; is not the solution. A small, very very small act of yours can make someones day. Mind that this small act doesnot take much of your time. But in this cruel and fake world, people are good with scrolling ig rather than doing some small act that hardly take 1-2 minutes to make someones day.<br>
Ahhhhhh!!! We are living in a world filled with fake and fraud people. Sad.</p>
<h3 id="-08-mar-2023-wednesday"># 08-Mar-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Played holi with neighbours after 8-9 years. Enjoyed a lot and ate delicious foods. Made changes to Linkedin profile. Had quality discussion with <em>mama</em> (maternal uncle) on &ldquo;the right age for girls to get married?&rdquo;. I totally agree with him that the right age for girls to get married is 26-28. But due to some internal reasons that I can&rsquo;t mention here, I was inclined towards 30-31 years is the right age for girls to get married. Whatever points <em>mama</em> told to support his thought, I completely agree with him.<br>
I also know that today&rsquo;s generation will not understand all this. They all are of the mentality that, &ldquo;This is my life, I will do things what I like and when I like&rdquo;. But they are wrong. They are unaware of the asramas mentioned in our scriptures. The four asramas are: Brahmacharya (student), Gṛhastha (householder), Vanaprastha (forest walker/forest dweller), and Sannyasa (renunciate). The Asrama system is one facet of the Dharma concept in Hinduism. And to fully enjoy the life, it has to be equally divided into these asramas. If todays generation gets married in their 30&rsquo;s, then how will they manage the rest of the life i.e. Gṛhastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa. If a person is getting married in his/her 30&rsquo;s, then his/her life should be of atleast 120-130 years to actually enjoy the life.<br>
Had fun with cousins. <em>nii</em> and I listened to <em>Altaf Raja</em> songs (Aawara Hawa Ka Jhonka Hoon, Tum To Thehre Pardesi). Went to drop her to station at night. Came back home and messaged some of my friends <em>Happy Holi</em>, including <em>Bajpai</em>. It was just 5-10 minutes left to 12 midnight. Hahahaaaa ha ha. Funny. Btw, I was busy whole day, so didn&rsquo;t get time to message anyone.<br>
This <em>Holi</em> was special for many reasons. <strong>Bugs</strong> showed his face. He uploaded a video on ig doing face reveal. When I saw, I started shouting and couldn&rsquo;t believe what just happened. I cann&rsquo;t express what was going inside my mind and body. You start watching some youtuber with just 1k-2k subscribers. Slowly you start falling in love with the youtuber. He makes you addicted to his videos. Everyday you check youtube to check whether he uploaded some video or not. And after 3 years, you get to see his face. Ohhhhhh. What a moment!! I started watching him from 2021. He didn&rsquo;t teach me all the linux stuff that I know right now. The credit of my linux knowledge goes to many people around the world. What <strong>Bugs</strong> did is, he inspired me to pursue linux instead of so many problems. He put fire in me for the free and open source softwares. He inspired me to have personal website. To have personal mail. He showed me the cool world of linux. He is my man. Thanks <em>bugs</em>.</p>

<p>Went to meet <em>dada-dadi</em> (grandparents). Played chess with <em>nii</em>. Watched some iit dance videos with her. Discussed about counselling procedure. Went to see moon, jupiter and venus on recommendation of <em>Patel</em>. But no luck. On east side moon was there. But on west side, no shiny object found. Maybe my timing was wrong. Applied for BARC exam. Felt good-good because of less headache.</p>

<p>Had fun with <em>nii</em>. Discussed many things. Watched dance videos together. And some funny ones too. Also showed her some cool linux scripts that I wrote. Went to meet relatives. We four played mini militia too. Obviously, I won. Commented on <em>Bajpai&rsquo;s</em> ig post. Headache is persistent. I am thinking of starting meditaion and running in morning to release some good hormones. It might help in fixing my headache. Or might not? Lets see.</p>
<h3 id="-05-mar-2023-sunday"># 05-Mar-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Learnt about imagemagick commands. Wrote a script to remove exif data and then to annonate the custom date and place in the image using convert. Soon will be publishing it on my blog and github. Went to assi with <em>prateek</em>. Clicked some photos, will be posting it on my personal gallery. Headache was there. I don&rsquo;t know when my situation will improve.<br>
Btw, this same day of the last month, I called her to get the worst news. She said she doesn&rsquo;t have feelings anymore and wants breakup. The exact line were - <em>Ab wo baat nahi rahi. Ab feelings nahi rahi</em>. I was shocked.<br>
Then I contacted her close friend <em>Kumari</em> (she was her roommate in the infosys training center mysore and also her 4 year college friend), and told her the situation. Then <em>Kumari</em> said that, she(my ex) got very close to a boy named <em>Shiva Hosamani</em>. They used to have everything together. Having breakfast, lunch, dinner. Going to malls, waching movies. Playing games, cycling. Everything they used to do together. <em>Kumari</em> told me that she was her roommate just for sleeping at night, rest of the time she was with <em>Shiva Hosamani</em>. <em>Kumari</em> also said that people in the infosys training campus started questioning them, <em>&ldquo;Is there something between you both?&rdquo;</em>. Even <em>Kumari</em> asked her about her relationship with <em>Shiva Hosamani</em> and what about your relationship with <em>nikhil</em>?<br>
But no, she played very well. She didn&rsquo;t tell anyone. She kept it secret. When I called her on this day of the last month, then she tells me that she doesn&rsquo;t have feelings for me anymore. Hahahahahaaahaaa haaahaaahaa. So funny. When you do everything with a male person(<em>Shiva Hosamani</em>), eating, drinking, playing, studing, watching movies, bicycling, and many more things, then you  tell me that you don&rsquo;t have feelings for me anymore. Good game <em>Yadav</em>, good game. She used to tell me I am shatir (clever). But it turns out that she is more shatir (clever) than me.<br>
One of the reasons why Long Distance Relationships don&rsquo;t work is loyalty. People cheat in LDR. I don&rsquo;t know from where she learnt all this. Was this type of teaching given by her family, Or was it her close friends, who taught her all this? Even in my dreams, I never thought that she would cheat on me. But now its reality. Even her friends <em>Kumari</em> and <em>Srivastava</em> are like her. Are all girls like this? Is being loyal so hard in present time?<br>
Its life long lesson for me. One of the worst feeling is <em>being used as an object</em>. She used me. But I never used her. Never. But no problem. <strong>Karma</strong> is there, it will take care of everything. No one can escape Karma. And she has to pay very heavy price for what she has done. Using someone when required, and then throwing him because no use now. Its wrong. Torturing someone like this, pushing him in the deep well of depression. Its wrong. Karma will punish her. Not only her, but me too. Maybe whats happening with me is result of my bad Karma. Maybe&hellip;..</p>
<h3 id="-04-mar-2023-saturday"># 04-Mar-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>Less headache than yesterday, yupp its krishna&rsquo;s mercy. Had the plan of going to assi with <em>prateek</em>. But cancelled it and went to night walk nearby with him. Made idm vs aria2c meme and uploaded to reddit. The day went well. In evening headache started, and esclated slowly slowly. At night it was at its peak. Had discussion about her with <em>pradeep</em>. Told him that this is the last discussion we are having about her. I don&rsquo;t want any more bullshits. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about liers and fake people.<br>
I have come to realisation that, whatever happened cann&rsquo;t be reversed. So accept it and move on. People in this world are way too selfish. She used me. Used me for everything. And I helped her in every possible way. Now, she got someone else, so she dumped me. I was use and throw for her. Basically, I was object for her. I gave 110% of my time and energy and she didn&rsquo;t put any effort. And now she is blaming me for making the relationship toxic. And she played fake love so well that I didn&rsquo;t get any hint. She faked it for using me. She wasted my precious 1 year. Ahhhhhh cruel world!!!<br>
What I learnt from all this - there is no place for good people in this fake world. So, <em>maa chudhaye sab, humko kya</em> (Let everyone get their mothers fucked, I don&rsquo;t care anymore). Be happy yourself. Don&rsquo;t care for anyone, they have got their own hands, legs, eyes, brain,&hellip; They can take care of themself. You focus on your goal.</p>
<h3 id="-03-mar-2023-friday"># 03-Mar-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Today it was <em>Amalaki Ekadashi</em>. So I was on fast as usual.<br>
I am in deep deep depression. I don&rsquo;t know how much time it will take for me to recover from this pain. There is nobody with whom I can share my sadness. No one will understand me. Constant headache, all day all night. Sometimes I feel like banging my head in wall. And other times I feel like cutting my skull and putting some ice inside, then stiching the skull back.<br>
Also I redesigned my website. Earlier I was using <em>gruvhugo</em> theme but now it&rsquo;s <em>charlolamode</em> theme. I am doing all this to keep myself busy. I don&rsquo;t want to remember her anymore. She has done very bad with me. Nobody in this world has the right to play with someone for fun. I repeat, nobody. Who has given you the right to play with someone&rsquo;s emotions.<br>
I hope I don&rsquo;t take any wrong steps. Krishna, please help me. This world is filled with cruel, fake and fraud people. And I don&rsquo;t want to live with them. Please give me strength Krishna.<br>
Hare krishna hare krishna, krishna krishna hare hare.<br>
Hare rama hare rama, rama rama hare hare.</p>
