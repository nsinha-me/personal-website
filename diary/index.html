<p>Hi, I am Nikhil Sinha. I was born on 14-Jan-1999.<br>
Date of starting this diary : 03-Mar-2023.</p>
<p>What you are reading is my entire life&rsquo;s journey. I am writing all this as a proof of my existence. My emotions, my feelings, my views, my ideas and my experiences. Existence needs witness, reality is related to mind. This is why, I want you to know - I existed. I was sad at this day, I was happy on that day. Anyone around the world can be aware of my existence, even after I die. Yes ofc, one day I will sure die, not sure when. Day by day people will forget me. But thanks to internet even 100 years after my death, someone can look into my existence. Someone, just like me.</p>

<h3 id="-15-mar-2023-wednesday"># 15-Mar-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Woke up at 3pm. Made 4 memes back to back. Got mixed reactions. My fav. was love marriage to arrange marriage meme, because it took some real effort in making it. Went to meet <em>choti maa</em>, had discussion about <em>dada-dadi</em>. Played with <em>syncthing</em> setting. Backed up some files using it. Looked at Imagemagick documentation, its vast. Also, to fix my sleeping schedule, I will not sleep today.</p>
<h3 id="-14-mar-2023-tuesday"># 14-Mar-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p><em>nana-nani and mami</em> came to meet us. Had fun with them. Got to learn many things from their experiences. Sent the blog link to my friends. Again <em>pradeep</em> was asking about whats the use of this blinking effect. How to explain him, I don&rsquo;t know. Not everything is done for the purpose of use. I did it because I found it interesting. And after making it I was happy-happy. <em>Bajpai</em> appreciated it. Had chit-chat with her. On some of her messages I reacted with heart emoji. She might think that I am simping. But I didn&rsquo;t. I generally don&rsquo;t react on messages, but lately using ig I have started reacting to messages and reels sent by heart emoji. And the same habbit reciprocated to whatsapp.<br>
Finally installed <em>syncthing</em> on my phone and laptop. I have to test its various settings to decide which one suits my use case. Then I will delete google photos. Fuck google.</p>
<h3 id="-13-mar-2023-monday"># 13-Mar-2023 Monday</h3>
<p>Went to <em>samneghat</em> to buy medicines. Wifi connection problem solved. Wrote blog about the flashing effect that I created 2 days ago. Created short tutorials about the telegram hacks and posted it on ig. Nobody responded, as usual. IG is cringe because it has cringe audience. Most of the people who use ig are dumb.<br>
Mental health is improving slowly-slowly. Headache is minimal. I am not getting time for meditation and exercise. My sleeping schedule is disturbed. Going to sleep at 6am and then waking up at 12 noon is not good. Sometimes I get scolded also. I need to fix this asap.</p>
<h3 id="-12-mar-2023-sunday"># 12-Mar-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Woke up in noon. Sleep cycle is pretty much fucked for sure. Went to meet dada-dadi (grandparents), as usual had verbal fight for the same old reason. I don&rsquo;t understand why they are doing like this. Their stubbornness will only harm them, and not the rest of the family. This is great learning for me. I don&rsquo;t know what I will do in my old age, but definitely sure that what my grandparents are doing, I will not do it.<br>
Asked my friends about the blinking gif I created yesterday, got most of the votes for 50fps, 1 for 18fps and 1 for 24fps. Personally, my vote goes for 24fps, because this is the sprit with which I created the gif. Also, the 50fps gif is slow blinking due to the fact that people are unable to comprehend it. So, its appearing as slow-slow.</p>
<h3 id="-11-mar-2023-saturday"># 11-Mar-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>I have started procrastinating a lot. Thats not good. Created two memes. One was normal, about CTC vs inhand. And the other was about BTS. But people reacted 6 times more on low effort meme about CTC in comparision to BTS meme. Was my BTS meme so normiee?? I made it for fun, and not to hurt someone. Also, the meme was not so dark. I&rsquo;m confused now. To grow in marketing and advertisement field, I need to know how people respond. I have to create more content to know how people react.<br>
Made blinking effect with the help of imagemagick and ffmpeg. Felt happy-happy, because it was something new I did and its rare in todays society what I did.<br>
Also, headache is subduing. But when it comes from time to time, its unbearable. Krishna, please help. You are <em>Sarva karanah karanam</em>. I know whats happening with me has some hidden cause. You and only you know the cause. Whatever you do is correct without any doubt. But krishna, please take away my headache. Please make me old nikhil, that used to be full of humour and joy and didn&rsquo;t have any headache. Please krishna.<br>
Hare Krishna.</p>
<h3 id="-10-mar-2023-friday"># 10-Mar-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Met many people today. Cousin and <em>mami</em> in the afternoon, neighbours in the evening, <em>bua</em>(paternal aunt) and <em>prateek</em> at night. Had discussion about feminism with neighbours. Also talked about jobs in tech industry with them. At night went to <em>Bhullanpur Station</em> with <em>prateek</em>.<br>
Bugs did face revel on yt today. What a fucking video to watch this morning, it was looking like he has RGB lighting system inside his body. Haa haa haahahahah. I know it was ffmpeg magic. He probably did this by constantly changing the colors by selecting some specific color from the present frame.</p>
<h3 id="-09-mar-2023-thursday"># 09-Mar-2023 Thursday</h3>
<p>Lost days of nofap streak this morning. Sigh!! Lets make new nofap streak. This time I am more stronger. Added some notes to my website. Talked to <em>lavish</em> about gate counselling. Talked to <em>pradeep</em> about the same. But the talk went 2 hours long. Had some good discussion with him. <em>Patel</em> called to inform me that venus and jupiter are clearly visible. Went outside to watch, <em>Patel</em> was on the call. Happy to see the Venus aka the evening star, but sadly the jupiter was not visible. Switched to video call to show <em>Patel</em> how the Venus looked from my POV. Being a girl(and that&rsquo;s important here), she accepted the video call without any second thought. Walking back home, I was on video call with her. Had some 5-6 minutes talk. Then she told me to talk to her mother on video call. I felt shy, so told her not to do so. But alas!! Her mother was on video call and we excahged greetings. Then <em>Patel</em> showed me <em>aalu sabji</em> her mother was making. Watched some videos about Obsidian. I will be switching to Obsidian for notes making and managing my tasks.<br>
In this busy society, showing you care for someone can be a challenging task. I am completely aware of the fact that nowadays people are busy, they don&rsquo;t have time for anyone. But but but, who the fuck wants to eat someone&rsquo;s time. What people want is closeness. A small act can show the care and closeness between two people. This act can vary from time to time and person to person. By saying that &ldquo;I am busy, I don&rsquo;t have time,&hellip;.&rdquo; is not the solution. A small, very very small act of yours can make someones day. Mind that this small act doesnot take much of your time. But in this cruel and fake world, people are good with scrolling ig rather than doing some small act that hardly take 1-2 minutes to make someones day.<br>
Ahhhhhh!!! We are living in a world filled with fake and fraud people. Sad.</p>
<h3 id="-08-mar-2023-wednesday"># 08-Mar-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Played holi with neighbours after 8-9 years. Enjoyed a lot and ate delicious foods. Made changes to Linkedin profile. Had quality discussion with <em>mama</em> (maternal uncle) on &ldquo;the right age for girls to get married?&rdquo;. I totally agree with him that the right age for girls to get married is 26-28. But due to some internal reasons that I can&rsquo;t mention here, I was inclined towards 30-31 years is the right age for girls to get married. Whatever points <em>mama</em> told to support his thought, I completely agree with him.<br>
I also know that today&rsquo;s generation will not understand all this. They all are of the mentality that, &ldquo;This is my life, I will do things what I like and when I like&rdquo;. But they are wrong. They are unaware of the asramas mentioned in our scriptures. The four asramas are: Brahmacharya (student), Gṛhastha (householder), Vanaprastha (forest walker/forest dweller), and Sannyasa (renunciate). The Asrama system is one facet of the Dharma concept in Hinduism. And to fully enjoy the life, it has to be equally divided into these asramas. If todays generation gets married in their 30&rsquo;s, then how will they manage the rest of the life i.e. Gṛhastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa. If a person is getting married in his/her 30&rsquo;s, then his/her life should be of atleast 120-130 years to actually enjoy the life.<br>
Had fun with cousins. <em>nii</em> and I listened to <em>Altaf Raja</em> songs (Aawara Hawa Ka Jhonka Hoon, Tum To Thehre Pardesi). Went to drop her to station at night. Came back home and messaged some of my friends <em>Happy Holi</em>, including <em>Bajpai</em>. It was just 5-10 minutes left to 12 midnight. Hahahaaaa ha ha. Funny. Btw, I was busy whole day, so didn&rsquo;t get time to message anyone.<br>
This <em>Holi</em> was special for many reasons. <strong>Bugs</strong> showed his face. He uploaded a video on ig doing face reveal. When I saw, I started shouting and couldn&rsquo;t believe what just happened. I cann&rsquo;t express what was going inside my mind and body. You start watching some youtuber with just 1k-2k subscribers. Slowly you start falling in love with the youtuber. He makes you addicted to his videos. Everyday you check youtube to check whether he uploaded some video or not. And after 3 years, you get to see his face. Ohhhhhh. What a moment!! I started watching him from 2021. He didn&rsquo;t teach me all the linux stuff that I know right now. The credit of my linux knowledge goes to many people around the world. What <strong>Bugs</strong> did is, he inspired me to pursue linux instead of so many problems. He put fire in me for the free and open source softwares. He inspired me to have personal website. To have personal mail. He showed me the cool world of linux. He is my man. Thanks <em>bugs</em>.</p>
<h3 id="-07-mar-2023-tuesday"># 07-Mar-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Went to meet <em>dada-dadi</em> (grandparents). Played chess with <em>nii</em>. Watched some iit dance videos with her. Discussed about counselling procedure. Went to see moon, jupiter and venus on recommendation of <em>Patel</em>. But no luck. On east side moon was there. But on west side, no shiny object found. Maybe my timing was wrong. Applied for BARC exam. Felt good-good because of less headache.</p>
<h3 id="-06-mar-2023-monday"># 06-Mar-2023 Monday</h3>
<p>Had fun with <em>nii</em>. Discussed many things. Watched dance videos together. And some funny ones too. Also showed her some cool linux scripts that I wrote. Went to meet relatives. We four played mini militia too. Obviously, I won. Commented on <em>Bajpai&rsquo;s</em> ig post. Headache is persistent. I am thinking of starting meditaion and running in morning to release some good hormones. It might help in fixing my headache. Or might not? Lets see.</p>
<h3 id="-05-mar-2023-sunday"># 05-Mar-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Learnt about imagemagick commands. Wrote a script to remove exif data and then to annonate the custom date and place in the image using convert. Soon will be publishing it on my blog and github. Went to assi with <em>prateek</em>. Clicked some photos, will be posting it on my personal gallery. Headache was there. I don&rsquo;t know when my situation will improve.<br>
Btw, this same day of the last month, I called her to get the worst news. She said she doesn&rsquo;t have feelings anymore and wants breakup. The exact line were - <em>Ab wo baat nahi rahi. Ab feelings nahi rahi</em>. I was shocked.<br>
Then I contacted her close friend <em>Kumari</em> (she was her roommate in the infosys training center mysore and also her 4 year college friend), and told her the situation. Then <em>Kumari</em> said that, she(my ex) got very close to a boy named <em>Shiva Hosamani</em>. They used to have everything together. Having breakfast, lunch, dinner. Going to malls, waching movies. Playing games, cycling. Everything they used to do together. <em>Kumari</em> told me that she was her roommate just for sleeping at night, rest of the time she was with <em>Shiva Hosamani</em>. <em>Kumari</em> also said that people in the infosys training campus started questioning them, <em>&ldquo;Is there something between you both?&rdquo;</em>. Even <em>Kumari</em> asked her about her relationship with <em>Shiva Hosamani</em> and what about your relationship with <em>nikhil</em>?<br>
But no, she played very well. She didn&rsquo;t tell anyone. She kept it secret. When I called her on this day of the last month, then she tells me that she doesn&rsquo;t have feelings for me anymore. Hahahahahaaahaaa haaahaaahaa. So funny. When you do everything with a male person(<em>Shiva Hosamani</em>), eating, drinking, playing, studing, watching movies, bicycling, and many more things, then you  tell me that you don&rsquo;t have feelings for me anymore. Good game <em>Yadav</em>, good game. She used to tell me I am shatir (clever). But it turns out that she is more shatir (clever) than me.<br>
One of the reasons why Long Distance Relationships don&rsquo;t work is loyalty. People cheat in LDR. I don&rsquo;t know from where she learnt all this. Was this type of teaching given by her family, Or was it her close friends, who taught her all this? Even in my dreams, I never thought that she would cheat on me. But now its reality. Even her friends <em>Kumari</em> and <em>Srivastava</em> are like her. Are all girls like this? Is being loyal so hard in present time?<br>
Its life long lesson for me. One of the worst feeling is <em>being used as an object</em>. She used me. But I never used her. Never. But no problem. <strong>Karma</strong> is there, it will take care of everything. No one can escape Karma. And she has to pay very heavy price for what she has done. Using someone when required, and then throwing him because no use now. Its wrong. Torturing someone like this, pushing him in the deep well of depression. Its wrong. Karma will punish her. Not only her, but me too. Maybe whats happening with me is result of my bad Karma. Maybe&hellip;..</p>
<h3 id="-04-mar-2023-saturday"># 04-Mar-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>Less headache than yesterday, yupp its krishna&rsquo;s mercy. Had the plan of going to assi with <em>prateek</em>. But cancelled it and went to night walk nearby with him. Made idm vs aria2c meme and uploaded to reddit. The day went well. In evening headache started, and esclated slowly slowly. At night it was at its peak. Had discussion about her with <em>pradeep</em>. Told him that this is the last discussion we are having about her. I don&rsquo;t want any more bullshits. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about liers and fake people.<br>
I have come to realisation that, whatever happened cann&rsquo;t be reversed. So accept it and move on. People in this world are way too selfish. She used me. Used me for everything. And I helped her in every possible way. Now, she got someone else, so she dumped me. I was use and throw for her. Basically, I was object for her. I gave 110% of my time and energy and she didn&rsquo;t put any effort. And now she is blaming me for making the relationship toxic. And she played fake love so well that I didn&rsquo;t get any hint. She faked it for using me. She wasted my precious 1 year. Ahhhhhh cruel world!!!<br>
What I learnt from all this - there is no place for good people in this fake world. So, <em>maa chudhaye sab, humko kya</em> (Let everyone get their mothers fucked, I don&rsquo;t care anymore). Be happy yourself. Don&rsquo;t care for anyone, they have got their own hands, legs, eyes, brain,&hellip; They can take care of themself. You focus on your goal.</p>
<h3 id="-03-mar-2023-friday"># 03-Mar-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Today it was <em>Amalaki Ekadashi</em>. So I was on fast as usual.<br>
I am in deep deep depression. I don&rsquo;t know how much time it will take for me to recover from this pain. There is nobody with whom I can share my sadness. No one will understand me. Constant headache, all day all night. Sometimes I feel like banging my head in wall. And other times I feel like cutting my skull and putting some ice inside, then stiching the skull back.<br>
Also I redesigned my website. Earlier I was using <em>gruvhugo</em> theme but now it&rsquo;s <em>charlolamode</em> theme. I am doing all this to keep myself busy. I don&rsquo;t want to remember her anymore. She has done very bad with me. Nobody in this world has the right to play with someone for fun. I repeat, nobody. Who has given you the right to play with someone&rsquo;s emotions.<br>
I hope I don&rsquo;t take any wrong steps. Krishna, please help me. This world is filled with cruel, fake and fraud people. And I don&rsquo;t want to live with them. Please give me strength Krishna.<br>
Hare krishna hare krishna, krishna krishna hare hare.<br>
Hare rama hare rama, rama rama hare hare.</p>
