<p>Hi, I am Nikhil Sinha. I was born on 14-Jan-1999.<br>
Date of starting this diary : 03-Mar-2023.</p>
<p>What you are reading is my entire life&rsquo;s journey. I am writing all this as a proof of my existence. My emotions, my feelings, my views, my ideas and my experiences. Existence needs witness, reality is related to mind. This is why, I want you to know - I existed. I was sad at this day, I was happy on that day. Anyone around the world can be aware of my existence, even after I die. Yes ofc, one day I will sure die, not sure when. Day by day people will forget me. But thanks to internet even 100 years after my death, someone can look into my existence. Someone, just like me.</p>

<h3 id="-26-may-2023-friday"># 26-May-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Updated the diary. Talked to <em>shajid sir</em>(client) as <em>lavish</em> was busy. <em>ravi</em> called in night. He is also fed up of crypto laws. Haaha haha ha. Took his learning id and password.<br>
Have to take proper sleep. <em>Nirjala ekadashi</em> is coming, have to prepare my body for it. Have stayed nirjal in <em>janmashtami</em>, but it was only for 12-14hrs. But in this ekadashi, i have to be nirjal for approx 24-30hrs. It will be so much fun. Happy.<br>
Hare Krishna.</p>
<h3 id="-25-may-2023-thursday"># 25-May-2023 Thursday</h3>
<p>Watched some emacs videos. Went to meet <em>chhoti maa</em>. Talked to <em>lavish</em> at night about the progress.</p>
<h3 id="-24-may-2023-wednesday"># 24-May-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Did some ffmpeg and imagemagick practice. In night, <em>vishal bhaiya</em> came to meet. Used ig more than avg. Trying to find more business ideas.</p>
<h3 id="-23-may-2023-tuesday"># 23-May-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Learnt more about hugo. Searched for gallery code for my personal insta. I think I have to create my own theme/template for this. Saw bugs website. He redesigned it, and now looking more cool. He is inspiration.<br>
Talked to <em>ravi</em> in morning around 5am for 1hr. I have all mad people around me. Sent him some message, he was awake. He rang my phone and the discussion went 1hr long. Mental people. When its time for others to wake up, we are having discussion on random topic. Funny.<br>
Made script to take down some websites.<br>
People use so many manipulative tricks. I hate them.</p>
<h3 id="-22-may-2023-monday"># 22-May-2023 Monday</h3>
<p><em>mama</em> came in afternoon. Learnt some more vim and hugo. Awesome feeling. Learning something new is good. Was missing this from many days.<br>
Again started practicing typing. Crossed 50 wpm. Also tried solving leetcode problem. Ohhhh man, missed this coding so much. &ldquo;C&rdquo; is the best language. &ldquo;C&rdquo; is love. All other languages are bloated.</p>
<h3 id="-21-may-2023-sunday"># 21-May-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Took break from work. Discussed with <em>lavish</em> about future plans. Talked to <em>pradeep</em> at night. Watched videos about <em>rsync</em> and practiced it. Learnt some <em>hugo</em> stuff too. Happy-happy.<br>
Phone fell from hand and touchscreen broke. Ahhhhhh sad. Now i have liquid damaged phone with broken glass. Cool.</p>
<h3 id="-20-may-2023-saturday"># 20-May-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>In evening, went to <em>surya sarovar</em> with <em>prateek</em>. Watched &ldquo;The Kerala Story&rdquo; with him in hall. At night, went to the wedding of <em>pooja</em>. Enjoyed. Met many village people. Happy.</p>
<h3 id="-19-may-2023-friday"># 19-May-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Dropped <em>nii</em> at station. She is intelligent. Outshines me everytime. Haahaa haha.</p>
<h3 id="-18-may-2023-thursday"># 18-May-2023 Thursday</h3>
<p>Went to <em>dada</em> house. The same old family problem. Fed up now. Woke up all night to finish client work. Have to increase my speed. Used ig too long. Approx 3hrs. Fuck. I will become normie like this.<br>
Had chit-chat and fun with <em>nii</em>. Tomorrow she will leave for <em>mohali</em> internship.</p>
<h3 id="-17-may-2023-wednesday"># 17-May-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>My family drama is more interesting than most of the movie story. Went to hospital and got <em>Tetanus</em> injection and some medicine for the ankle injury. Its swollen. Also, doctor said to do surgery for <em>dadi</em> knee problem.</p>
<h3 id="-16-may-2023-tuesday"># 16-May-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know why, but from 3-4 days, very happy-happy.<br>
<em>lavish</em> again gave good news. But i think it is problem. Everytime getting client and work is not good in initial phases. Having lows are imp. If after getting some success, then our low hits, it will break us apart.<br>
Uploaded ig story about exact date and time of current ig dp. Got some good reach due to story replies. Late night, uploaded story about pradeep.<br>
Got hurt in ankle with 1L steel water bottle. Was playing catch-catch with it.</p>

Personal opinion - Frontend is bullshitttttttt.</p>
<h3 id="-14-may-2023-sunday"># 14-May-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Not productive day. Wordpress is illogical, its not for me. Used gpt3, not liked it. It gives answer directly. If i google search and then go to sites like stackexchage, stackoverflow or archwiki, along with answer I will get to know something more. But with gpt3, my knowledge will not increase. <em>lavish</em> sent the pdf of <em>The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant</em>. Good book.<br>
Made <em>instaloader</em> tutorial video using <em>termux</em> to upload on ig. But did not upload because ig audience is dumb. Nobody gives a fuck to the tutorial video on ig story. It was fun making it, a small error and record the whole video again. Haahaahahaha haa haa.<br>
Tomorrow is ekadashi, going to sleep early.</p>
<h3 id="-13-may-2023-saturday"># 13-May-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>Swastik Associates people messaged. Lots of work to do. <em>bugs</em> messaged on ig his new blog post. It was funny.</p>
<h3 id="-12-may-2023-friday"># 12-May-2023 Friday</h3>

<h3 id="-11-may-2023-thursday"># 11-May-2023 Thursday</h3>
<p>Went to meet <em>akash</em> in morning. IITD campus was too big. Had breakfast there. Discussed about stock market.<br>
Uploaded stories on ig. Last travel.<br>
At night, Swastik Associates manager called to discuss the project. Excited. Its big project with big money.<br>
Told <em>nii</em>, what <em>Bajpai</em> told me.</p>
<h3 id="-10-may-2023-wednesday"># 10-May-2023 Wednesday</h3>
<p>Did packing in morning. Staying these 4 days with <em>ravi</em> was fun. His brain is fast. I like it. But the problem is, he is lazy.<br>
Came to <em>delhi</em> station. Old lady had heavy luggage and was climbing the stairs. I took the luggage and helped her in climbing the stairs.<br>
Bought a cup of tea. Was missing it from many days. Had time, so was roaming on the platform. Two transgenders called me. She said, &ldquo;Jaha se chai liya hai na, waha se ja kar do kurkure le aa&rdquo; and she gave me 100 rupees. Very happy. Bought the kurkure and gave her. Happy. Was shocked that she gave me 100 rupees. I could have ran away. The world runs on trust. Very happy to help transgenders. In india, transgenders have no respect. Not good, because its not their fault. I want to help them. Also, i have attended a talk show in college in my 1st year btech.<br>
Went to IIT Ropar. It was big. Had dinner in mess. Did little walk and chat with <em>nii</em>. Happy-happy. Took photos and came back to station.<br>
Got advance payment from the client. <em>lavish</em> and I have decided to register the company asap, so that we can take advantage from it. Happy that i have <em>lavish</em>. He doesnot fear hardwork. We have also decided to simultaneously work on our 3-4 ideas as we have less time. Will try out best to go in same college, probably in <em>delhi</em>.<br>
Happy day. Happy happy.</p>
<h3 id="-09-may-2023-tuesday"># 09-May-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Did the mail work in morning. We got our 2nd client. In evening, went to meet <em>Bajpai</em>. Told her everything about what happened between me and <em>paranjal</em>. She also told me something. She is mature and understanding. Happy-happy.<br>
<em>delhi</em> is filled with too much showoff. I hate it.</p>
<h3 id="-08-may-2023-monday"># 08-May-2023 Monday</h3>
<p>What a day. Roller coaster ride of emotions.<br>
<em>lavish</em> said that he can&rsquo;t come to college as he was busy. <em>ravi</em> had meeting. So, I didn&rsquo;t have any close ones who could come to college with me. Sad. Thought of not going to college as the memories will haunt me.<br>
Took the courage to go to college alone. Firstly, went to meet warden sir. <em>mishra sir</em> was on leave, had conversation with <em>chaudhary sir</em>. Then met <em>ravi anand sir</em>. Then took the caution money form. Met library ma&rsquo;am. She is soooo good. Her name is <em>Sudha</em>. She is from <em>azamgarh</em>. She told me about PG from <em>germany</em> and what are its benefits. Took her phone number. Went to meet faculty. Had 1hr talk with <em>neeta ma&rsquo;am</em>. Discussed many topics. She wished me all the best for the future. Met <em>alpana ma&rsquo;am</em>. Took photo with her. PUT exams were going on, so she had to leave early. <em>Shailendra sir</em> was on leave. Rest all my favourite teachers have left the college. Finished the college document work. <em>Ritik Nautiyal</em> messaged that he is busy, and will not come to college to play badmintion in evening.<br>
Went to mess, talked with <em>rohit bhaiya</em> and had lunch with him. He is nice guy. Then went to meet <em>ajay bhaiya</em>(washerman). Both husband-wife were not there. They have started working in factory as there is less work in college and hence less money. Talked to all three childrens; <em>neha, nidhi</em> and <em>abhimanyu</em>. <em>neha</em> made <em>chai</em> for me. But I didn&rsquo;t feel good having <em>chai</em> alone. So, split it with <em>nidhi</em>. They showed me drawing and paintings they made. Took photos with them. Happy. After that met <em>ballu bhaiya</em>(room cleaner). Went in mess to have snacks. <em>rohit bhaiya</em> gave me the special <em>chai</em> that is made for the warden.<br>
Met <em>charu</em> in mess. He has also left hacking. Haahahaha. Funnyyyy. The path every indian hacker follows. Why? Because there is no money in ethical hacking in india. He also told about how <em>ayush</em> didn&rsquo;t get the highest package job due to &ldquo;ladki ka chakkar&rdquo; (the masculine urge to help every other female). Then met <em>vishal</em> aka <em>ramjee</em>. Met <em>ayush</em>. He told that he, <em>charu</em> and <em>achint</em> have taken our rooms. Cool. Took 5-6 rounds of college with <em>ramjee</em> and <em>ayush</em> and discussed about fest, placements,&hellip;..<br>
Met <em>gaurav lohani, shubham saini, achyut ojha, vaibhav upadhyay, harsh saxena, aniket tripathi, rishabh sahu, shani yadav, yash tripathi and mohd areeb</em>.<br>
While returning, met <em>sudhir bhaiya</em>. Called <em>Bajpai</em> and asked for meetup time and location. The call went too long. Happy.<br>
Ohhhhh man, I have battalion of good people around me. Why juniors talk to me? Why they respect me? Why did <em>neha</em> made <em>chai</em> for me? What is special in me? Its simple. I put effort in relationships. Just smile and ask them about the day. As simple as that. But people of this busy world are fine with scrolling ig rather than having conversation with real people. Sad.<br>
There is a problem. Why didn&rsquo;t the old memories with her haunt me? Why wasn&rsquo;t I sad for a single moment. Ahhhh, big problem. Yesterday night I was sad that how will I handle myself. Today morning, I thought of not going to college as none of my close one was coming along with me. In metro, thoughts were coming to return back to <em>ravi&rsquo;s</em> flat. But as soon as I reached college, nothing happend. Why? Not a single instance when I was sad. I roamed the whole college, but no sign of sadness, anger, depression. Nothing. But why? How this change happend so quickly? Confused!!!!</p>
<h3 id="-07-may-2023-sunday"># 07-May-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p><em>lavish</em> came to <em>ravi&rsquo;s</em> flat. Had fun. Played chess. Took photos. Revised our old memories. Discussed future plans. Slept for 1hr in evening, then <em>lavish</em> went. <em>Patel</em> called and we discussed about her TCS exam. Laptop is freezing in spawning new window. Have to fix this soon. At night, was sad a little. <em>Patel</em> messaged not to overthink. Had dinner late night around 3am.</p>
<h3 id="-06-may-2023-saturday"># 06-May-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>Arrived <em>delhi</em> in morning. Had <em>daal, chawal, dahi and bhujiya</em> cooked by <em>ravi</em> and <em>maik</em>. <em>ravi</em> and I went to <em>gurgaon</em> to  meet <em>bharat</em> and <em>barsaiyan</em> in evening. Played cards, ate and had fun. Gave them <em>bhang</em> and departed. Came back to <em>ravi</em> flat. Talked to <em>ravi</em>, played songs, danced. Showed my terminal skills to him. <em>ravi</em> took some <em>bhang</em>. <em>bharat</em> and group also took the <em>bhang</em> and the situation got out of control there(as usual). <em>Patel</em> called at night, she was sad. Talked to her, made her feel happy. <em>ravi</em> friend <em>maik</em> is good.</p>
<h3 id="-05-may-2023-friday"># 05-May-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Had fun in train. Talked to random guy in train. His name is <em>Sunny</em>. He is project engineer in <em>Swastik Associates</em>. He might give us some work. Happy. <em>lavish</em> is searching tools for automatic image generation. <em>Patel</em> called and woke me up in evening. Met <em>pradeep</em> around 8pm at <em>Lucknow</em> station. Those 10mins were soothing. Slept long to improve health.<br>

Womens are complicated creature.</p>
<h3 id="-02-may-2023-tuesday"># 02-May-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p>Searched ffmpeg command to convert the horizontal video to vertical video. Took time but I can script it out now. Happy. But it uses all the cores and my laptop freezes. I have to find solution for it. Rode cycle after 6 years. Happy. Explained <em>Patel</em> java class and object programs.<br>
At night, did server configuration again for the nginx. It worked. Nights are not good for work, especially for me. Urge to watch porn is high. I have to put lot of energy to control myself.<br>
Headache was there at night.</p>

<p>Fuck me. From last three days, my average sleep time is 3hrs/day. Muscle pain and headache at its peak. Bought the VPS from <em>justhost</em>. Very happy-happy. It was cheap, but latency is too much. Tradeoff. So cool, a linux server. Waooooo. Will be shifting my site to my server soon.</p>

Both time unsuccessful because the credit card company was blocking the internatinal transaction even though I turned on all the settings of international payments. Fuck these credit card companies. They can&rsquo;t prevent hacking, but they try to block the genuine payment. Fuck them.</p>

<p>Completed the website work. Tired. Sleepy. Just slept for 7 hrs in last 65 hours. What I learnt: by not sleeping I will get more time and I can do more work. But by taking proper sleep, I can focus on my work and can complete it in less time hence finish more work.</p>

I am enjoying it. <em>mama</em>(maternal uncle) came in evening to meet. I love <em>mama</em>. He is so good. I am thankful to god that he has given persons like <em>mama</em> in my life.

Had talk with <em>chota papa</em>(uncle) on call in the evening and he said he will come to meet me before I go to college. <em>pradeep</em> called, discussed about BARC and college and future plans. Called <em>lavish</em> to get basic guidance about tomorrow&rsquo;s BARC exam. Also, gave him warning that his time is over. Now he has to work for me. Otherwise I will hire someone else. Funny, haahaaaa ha ha. I have not studied anything from last 2 months. Going to flip my notes as fast as possible, then I will sleep. Algorithms and compilers are my favourite.

Did not see <em>romee</em> today. She was there with us from 2015. She was street dog, we just used to give her food and water. And sometimes space to sleep in rainy and winter days. She was not well from many days. From last 2 days she did not eat anything. Yesterday at night I gave her water and she drank some. She was there at back of the house. It was the last time we saw her. Tried to find her today. Searched every street nearby. She was not there. Sad. Who will bite me now? Who will run behind the scooty now? Sad. She was the best street dog. Best of the best. Wherever she is, krishna please take care of her. And if she is not there with us anymore, then please krishna give her good <em>yoni</em>. After this much pain, she deserves something good. Today is <em>Ram Navami</em>. Please krishna give her shelter under your feet. <em>Romee</em>. Now whom I will slap? Now with whom will I play?

<p>Boring day. Talked to many people on linkedin about the branch I should take. Confused which college to choose. Took <em>dadi</em>(grandmother) to hospital for blood test. Headache was also there. I am taking too much tension and also old memories are haunting me. How can someone play with someone? What wrong I did? Is this world filled with people like her? I thought she is different, but I was completely wrong. She is also like everyone. Fake and fraud. But no problem, <em>karma</em> will take care of everything. For her and for me too. Lets see what happens in future. I am happy because I am free now. I can do whatever I want. Sky is the limit, lets surpass that too.<br>
Didn&rsquo;t get time to watch <em>The Dropout</em>. Busy all day. I have to fill the colleges form fast. Today listened to new song <em>Kaun Disha Mein Leke Chala Re Batohiya</em> from movie <em>Nadiya Ke Paar</em>. It was good song.</p>

<p>Talked to <em>S. Maurya</em> on ig, and then on whatsapp about gate results, preparation and future plans. Completed the COAP details. Searched for colleges. Talked to <em>pradeep, lavish, akash, nii</em> about colleges. Sent some more connection requests on linkedin. <em>Gokul</em> from IITB told to keep BMT the last option. He suggested IEOR, GNR and CTARA branches. He rejected BMT due to research work it will involve and some companies don&rsquo;t allow BMT. He recommended IEOR because of technical work and interesting subjects but hard ones. Also, he told that IITB would be much better than mid NITs. Now, I am confused. I want to study CS and also get some time for my own things. I don&rsquo;t want to study side subjects. Neither do I have interest in AI/ML. I want low level system designs(as of now). After talking to <em>Gokul</em>, I am thinking of taking CS from NIT. Because I don&rsquo;t want to do research in something non-CS. I love biology, but doing research in it would be waste of time.<br>
Took <em>dadi</em>(grandmother) to hospital. I am listening to songs at high volume in earphones. This is not good. Headache was there. I have lot of pending work to do.<br>
Uninstalled <em>VSCodium</em>. Now i will use vim for all my work.</p>

He is now my meme friend. Haha haaa haaa.<br>
Downloaded one episode of <em>Modern Family</em>. Was hoping something hilarious but it was okayish for me. Then downloaded <em>The Dropout</em>. It is about startup. A girl who became the self made youngest billionaire in america. I am hoping this will not disappoint me. Probably this will be my last series of the year.<br>

Talked to <em>lavish</em> in night about COAP and colleges. <em>Patel</em> shared screenshot of her close moment that she wrote in notepad. Happy for her.<br>
Used terminal today for everything. Happy. For copying, pasting, opening, installing, &hellip; for everything I used command line. It will make me good and fast. Also uploaded dotfiles to github. Learnt about symlinks. I have to clean my external hard-disks. One is 1 TB and other is 1.5 TB. Both are almost full. They contain many duplicate files.<br>

I don&rsquo;t know what will be its outcome, but the decision that <em>pradeep</em> took are the decisions taken by brave people. Happy and proud.<br>
At night went to <em>assi ghat</em> with <em>prateek</em>. Talked to foreigners for 1 hour. They were from <em>Germany</em>. They came to India 3 weeks ago. And banaras was their last destination.

<p>Woke up at 9am. That&rsquo;s some impressive progress. <em>dada</em>(grandfather) diagnosed with <em>Osteoporosis</em>. Ahhhhhh sad. Doctor prescribed daily &amp; weekly medicines and treatment will take 3 years and for temproary pain relief gave <em>diclofenac</em> injection. Old age is filled with so many problems. I am happy that <em>dada</em> is with me and I am doing something for him. Not everyone gets this opportunity. Checked the BARC website. Downloaded the gate scorecard. Edited my linkedin profile and sent some connection requests. Talked to <em>lavish</em> about colleges.<br>
Yesterday <em>pradeep</em> recommended <em>scrcpy</em> tool for screen mirroring. What an awesome piece of software it is. Just does what is says with tons of features. Single command and the phone&rsquo;s screen is available on the laptop in interactive mode. In starting I tested with usb cable, but now I am using it on wifi network. Replied to whatsapp&rsquo;s messages. Scrolled instagram. Atleast now I am able to use my phone. I can see my messages and otp&rsquo;s.<br>
Instagram is filled with useless people. Everyone is posting their adventurous trip photos. Some are going to national parks, some to goa, some to hill stations, some come to banaras. I don&rsquo;t have problem with trips. Trips and having fun with friends is good as they help in having good mental health. Neither do I have problem with people posting these photos on ig. The main problem is these newly employeed kids don&rsquo;t know the value of investing money. They are spending so much money in these trips. On hotels, on cool dresses, on nice foods, &hellip;. Sick people. These people will understand it later. These people are very very useless. On friday night, half of my ig stories is filled with their stories showing how low level mindset they have. A boy will be dancing on dance floor and the caption will be &ldquo;Ab corporate naukar 2 din ki chhutti enjoy karega&rdquo;(Now corporate servant will enjoy 2 days leave). What is this man? Dumb people.<br>
Also, now the country is divided into two parts. Girls like koreans and boys like russians. These big ig account people and ig memers have made russian word so slang. I hate it. Shame on these people. They are not understanding its consequences. India is viewed as a country that has values and culture. The world knows that Indians respect everyone. But when the whole world and specially russia will come to know that russian is slang word in India. What will they think of us then? Such a derogatory slang it is. It will destroy India&rsquo;s respectful image. These ig people are making fun and gaining followers and likes but they don&rsquo;t know its result. IG is cringe app filled with cringe people.</p>

Headache is almost gone. Sometimes its there, but its very mild. Finally I am happy. Happy-happy.<br>

<p>Went to sleep at 1pm. Woke up at 5pm. Fuck. What is this man? I will become sick if I don&rsquo;t correct my sleep schedule. Phone has almost become unusable. Only the top section where it shows time and network is visible, and rest of the display becomes blank. I am thinking of mirroring the phone screen to laptop using the usb cable. For the same called <em>pradeep</em> but he didn&rsquo;t picked the call. Wrote blog about how to install arch linux.<br>
Completed the <em>Farzi</em> webseries. It was average for me. Sexual content was negligible. Perfect. Too much abusive language. Not at all perfect. Why does webseries use so much abusive language? Also, I was hoping of some more <em>kaabiliyat</em>(intelligence) by the lead actor. I don&rsquo;t understand why the person who works hard gets divorced. Didn&rsquo;t the wife already knew that the husband would not be able to give time. Then why did she marry him. Just to give divorce? This is not correct. Why marry someone who is dedicated to his work and would not be able to give time? If you already know the situation and want to marry, then why give divorce? Just don&rsquo;t marry him, as simple as that. Am I waiting for season 2? No. Will I watch season 2? No. Why? Because, it was not of my type.<br>
When I was out at night, I saw someone falling from his bike. Went to him. He was badly drunk. Then I and one more person went to drop the drunk uncle to his house 2km away. Should have I left him there thinking that someone will come and help him? <em>maa</em>(mother) keeps telling me not to get into these situations. She tells me that helping everytime is not good because the society is bad. But I don&rsquo;t understand all this. The goodness inside me is alive. Maybe someday I will get in trouble by helping someone, then I will understand.<br>
Politics in my family is growing. <em>maa</em> is saying not to get into all this and focus on studies and job. But I think, I have to do something. They are playing their moves, and I am not doing anything because I really don&rsquo;t want to indulge in all these things. Lets see what happens.</p>

Wiped <em>awesomewm</em> and installed <em>bspwm</em> on laptop. Happy. Now, I will document everything so that next time it will be easy for me. Also, I will upload the dot files to github.<br>
Downloaded <em>Farzi</em> webseries and watched 3 episodes. I have just watched 1 series in past 3 years and it was <em>Scam 1992</em>. I usually don&rsquo;t watch movies and series. I don&rsquo;t like their stories. I have watched <em>Mirzapur</em> part one, <em>Family Man</em> part one, but have not watched part two. Why? Because, its not my type.<br>
I have to setup my laptop quickly so that I can resume my work. Waking up all night is not good for me, because the urge to watch pornographic content are at its peak. I have to put lot of energy to control myself. I don&rsquo;t want to watch porn. Porn is for loosers. And I am not one of them.</p>

Funny, because I can buy new phone in this much money. Its still in working condition, but the display is flickering and touch is also not working correctly. He told to backup data, because it can be dead anytime. I have to backup data asap then I will insert sim card and connect to wifi/data. Aahhhhhhhh, a small mistake costed me this much. Sad.<br>
Installed <em>bspwm</em> on desktop. Yesterday on laptop, I think I was doing something wrong with <em>sxhkd</em>. Finally happy today.<br>
Went to <em>assi ghat</em> with <em>prateek</em> at night. The weather was cold. Enjoyed for 2 hours. Returned at 11pm.<br>
Some observations: There is always a tradeoff between time and money in real life. You can go with train and save money but waste time OR you can go with flight and spend money but save time. You can go to govt. hospitals and stand in queue and waste time but save money OR you can go to private hospitals and save time but spend money. (Today) I wasted 4 hours in <em>realme</em> service centre just to come to conclusion that I don&rsquo;t want to do any upgrades because its costly OR I could just have bought new phone and save time but spend money.</p>

Finally at night clean wiped to <em>awesomewm</em>. I wasted whole day in this, but got to learn many new things. Now I have to install all the packages. And configure them individually. Ohhhhhhh, lot of work to do. This time I will write all the process in blogs and script some of them, so that next time I don&rsquo;t waste this much time. <em>mama</em> came in evening to see <em>dada</em>. Made coffee for him. He loves coffee made by me. Took feedbacks from friends about the type of content I should <strong>not</strong> post on ig.<br>
At night I was driving scooty , suddenly it started raining. I got wet. No problem. Hailstones were also falling. They were hitting me on my face, head and hands very hard. No problem. But, I had phone in my pocket. I should have kept it inside scooty. It got wet and now the display is damaged. Sad. I have to take it to service centre tomorrow. Displays are too costly. Sad.<br>
I had bookmarked more than 800 websites in <em>firefox</em> on laptop. I had to clean wipe to install <em>awesomewm</em> and sadly could not backup the bookmarks. I have taken the backup of <em>/boot</em> and <em>/home</em>. Now, I have to search where the <em>firefox</em> kept the bookmarks. I have to restore it somehow.</p>

<p>Fasting <em>(Papamochani Ekadashi)</em>. Talked to <em>nii</em> about colleges. <em>DTU</em> seems to be good option, lets see what i get. First rain of the year. Got wet too, intentionally. Took scooty, went on small ride in <em>dlw</em> and listening to <em>radha kripa kataksh</em> and soft rain drops falling on me. Happy-happy.<br>
Hare Krishna.</p>
<h3 id="-17-mar-2023-friday"># 17-Mar-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Searched about colleges based on my gate score. Went to meet <em>nana-nani</em>. <em>mama</em> was also there. Discussed with them about the gate result. <em>nana</em> gave blessings that I will get admission in college. I also hugged <em>nana</em>. It was amazing. I don&rsquo;t remember when I hugged him last time. Very happy. Even in his old age, <em>nana</em> is so cool.<br>
<em>pradeep</em> said about me that &ldquo;My experience with relationships has made me more strong. I am not able to see it, but after 3-4 years I will be more stronger than rest of the emotional peoples and be thankful that all these relationship bullshits happened with me.&rdquo; He told me to remember this. I am writing it here as a proof for the future me. Chatted with <em>rohit</em> bhaiya of <em>IPEC Mess</em> on ig. Felt good-good.</p>

<p>Brought <em>dada</em> to <em>dlw</em> in morning. Slept for 2 hours in afternoon. Listened to <em>Vol 1</em> by <em>Honey Singh</em> in loop. This is not good. Listening to such derogatory songs once or twice for fun is okish but listening in loop is not at all good. It will destroy my taste for good songs. Also, it will pollute my subconscious mind slowly-slowly. Gate website got crashed due to heavy traffic. So instead of 4pm, the result came out around 10pm. Went to buy injection for <em>dada</em> (<em>Deca-Durabolin</em>). Night walk with <em>prateek</em> at <em>surya sarovar</em>. Saw gate result infront of him.<br>
Hmmmm, the result was neither good nor bad. It was what I deserved. But, after droping a year for preparation and the result comes out approx same as last year, sad. Was she responsible for all this? No. It was me who wasted my time, it was me who took the headache. How can someone waste my time, if i don&rsquo;t want. I am accountable for all this. Was time waste the only reason for my poor result? No. Split of energy in various directions, is my biggest problem. Whenever I prepare for something, I am not focused. I start doing things that are not so imp and could be done later. But my naughty mind. Ahhhhhh. I know what I am. I know how different I am form the rest of the crowd. I know my potential. The only thing required is focus. I have to concentrate on one thing. Spliting of time and brain power in many directions is not good. Lesson learnt: be happy yourself, don&rsquo;t give time and energy to anyone, and focus on only one thing.<br>
The <em>monika bansal</em> meme I made yesterday got some good views because of the shares it got. That means I have to create something that is relatable so that people share them. <em>pankaj</em> unfollowed me and <em>pradeep</em> both. Hahahaaahhaa ha ha. Funny. People don&rsquo;t know why I came to ig. They think that I came to ig like everyone comes, to follow and follow back and waste tons of time. But I have purpose.</p>

<p>Woke up at 3pm. Made 4 memes back to back. Got mixed reactions. My fav. was love marriage to arrange marriage meme, because it took some real effort in making it. Went to meet <em>choti maa</em>, had discussion about <em>dada-dadi</em>. Played with <em>syncthing</em> setting. Backed up some files using it. Looked at Imagemagick documentation, its vast. Gate result will be declared tomorrow. Also, to fix my sleeping schedule, I will not sleep today.</p>
<h3 id="-14-mar-2023-tuesday"># 14-Mar-2023 Tuesday</h3>
<p><em>nana-nani and mami</em> came to meet us. Had fun with them. Got to learn many things from their experiences. Sent the blog link to my friends. Again <em>pradeep</em> was asking about whats the use of this blinking effect. How to explain him, I don&rsquo;t know. Not everything is done for the purpose of use. I did it because I found it interesting. And after making it I was happy-happy. <em>Bajpai</em> appreciated it. Had chit-chat with her. On some of her messages I reacted with heart emoji. She might think that I am simping. But I didn&rsquo;t. I generally don&rsquo;t react on messages, but lately using ig I have started reacting to messages and reels sent by heart emoji. And the same habbit reciprocated to whatsapp.<br>
Finally installed <em>syncthing</em> on my phone and laptop. I have to test its various settings to decide which one suits my use case. Then I will delete google photos. Fuck google.</p>
<h3 id="-13-mar-2023-monday"># 13-Mar-2023 Monday</h3>
<p>Went to <em>samneghat</em> to buy medicines. Wifi connection problem solved. Wrote blog about the flashing effect that I created 2 days ago. Created short tutorials about the telegram hacks and posted it on ig. Nobody responded, as usual. IG is cringe because it has cringe audience. Most of the people who use ig are dumb.<br>
Mental health is improving slowly-slowly. Headache is minimal. I am not getting time for meditation and exercise. My sleeping schedule is disturbed. Going to sleep at 6am and then waking up at 12 noon is not good. Sometimes I get scolded also. I need to fix this asap.</p>
<h3 id="-12-mar-2023-sunday"># 12-Mar-2023 Sunday</h3>
<p>Woke up in noon. Sleep cycle is pretty much fucked for sure. Went to meet dada-dadi (grandparents), as usual had verbal fight for the same old reason. I don&rsquo;t understand why they are doing like this. Their stubbornness will only harm them, and not the rest of the family. This is great learning for me. I don&rsquo;t know what I will do in my old age, but definitely sure that what my grandparents are doing, I will not do it.<br>
Asked my friends about the blinking gif I created yesterday, got most of the votes for 50fps, 1 for 18fps and 1 for 24fps. Personally, my vote goes for 24fps, because this is the sprit with which I created the gif. Also, the 50fps gif is slow blinking due to the fact that people are unable to comprehend it. So, its appearing as slow-slow.</p>
<h3 id="-11-mar-2023-saturday"># 11-Mar-2023 Saturday</h3>
<p>I have started procrastinating a lot. Thats not good. Created two memes. One was normal, about CTC vs inhand. And the other was about BTS. But people reacted 6 times more on low effort meme about CTC in comparision to BTS meme. Was my BTS meme so normiee?? I made it for fun, and not to hurt someone. Also, the meme was not so dark. I&rsquo;m confused now. To grow in marketing and advertisement field, I need to know how people respond. I have to create more content to know how people react.<br>
Made blinking effect with the help of imagemagick and ffmpeg. Felt happy-happy, because it was something new I did and its rare in todays society what I did.<br>
Also, headache is subduing. But when it comes from time to time, its unbearable. Krishna, please help. You are <em>Sarva karanah karanam</em>. I know whats happening with me has some hidden cause. You and only you know the cause. Whatever you do is correct without any doubt. But krishna, please take away my headache. Please make me old nikhil, that used to be full of humour and joy and didn&rsquo;t have any headache. Please krishna.<br>
Hare Krishna.</p>

<p>Met many people today. Cousin and <em>mami</em> in the afternoon, neighbours in the evening, <em>bua</em>(paternal aunt) and <em>prateek</em> at night. Had discussion about feminism with neighbours. Also talked about jobs in tech industry with them. At night went to <em>Bhullanpur Station</em> with <em>prateek</em>.<br>
Bugs did face revel on yt today. What a fucking video to watch this morning, it was looking like he has RGB lighting system inside his body. Haa haa haahahahah. I know it was ffmpeg magic. He probably did this by constantly changing the colors by selecting some specific color from the present frame.</p>

<p>Lost days of nofap streak this morning. Sigh!! Lets make new nofap streak. This time I am more stronger. Added some notes to my website. Talked to <em>lavish</em> about gate counselling. Talked to <em>pradeep</em> about the same. But the talk went 2 hours long. Had some good discussion with him. <em>Patel</em> called to inform me that venus and jupiter are clearly visible. Went outside to watch, <em>Patel</em> was on the call. Happy to see the Venus aka the evening star, but sadly the jupiter was not visible. Switched to video call to show <em>Patel</em> how the Venus looked from my POV. Being a girl(and that&rsquo;s important here), she accepted the video call without any second thought. Walking back home, I was on video call with her. Had some 5-6 minutes talk. Then she told me to talk to her mother on video call. I felt shy, so told her not to do so. But alas!! Her mother was on video call and we excahged greetings. Then <em>Patel</em> showed me <em>aalu sabji</em> her mother was making. Watched some videos about Obsidian. I will be switching to Obsidian for notes making and managing my tasks.<br>
In this busy society, showing you care for someone can be a challenging task. I am completely aware of the fact that nowadays people are busy, they don&rsquo;t have time for anyone. But but but, who the fuck wants to eat someone&rsquo;s time. What people want is closeness. A small act can show the care and closeness between two people. This act can vary from time to time and person to person. By saying that &ldquo;I am busy, I don&rsquo;t have time,&hellip;.&rdquo; is not the solution. A small, very very small act of yours can make someones day. Mind that this small act doesnot take much of your time. But in this cruel and fake world, people are good with scrolling ig rather than doing some small act that hardly take 1-2 minutes to make someones day.<br>
Ahhhhhh!!! We are living in a world filled with fake and fraud people. Sad.</p>

<p>Played holi with neighbours after 8-9 years. Enjoyed a lot and ate delicious foods. Made changes to Linkedin profile. Had quality discussion with <em>mama</em> (maternal uncle) on &ldquo;the right age for girls to get married?&rdquo;. I totally agree with him that the right age for girls to get married is 26-28. But due to some internal reasons that I can&rsquo;t mention here, I was inclined towards 30-31 years is the right age for girls to get married. Whatever points <em>mama</em> told to support his thought, I completely agree with him.<br>
I also know that today&rsquo;s generation will not understand all this. They all are of the mentality that, &ldquo;This is my life, I will do things what I like and when I like&rdquo;. But they are wrong. They are unaware of the asramas mentioned in our scriptures. The four asramas are: Brahmacharya (student), Gṛhastha (householder), Vanaprastha (forest walker/forest dweller), and Sannyasa (renunciate). The Asrama system is one facet of the Dharma concept in Hinduism. And to fully enjoy the life, it has to be equally divided into these asramas. If todays generation gets married in their 30&rsquo;s, then how will they manage the rest of the life i.e. Gṛhastha, Vanaprastha and Sannyasa. If a person is getting married in his/her 30&rsquo;s, then his/her life should be of atleast 120-130 years to actually enjoy the life.<br>
Had fun with cousins. <em>nii</em> and I listened to <em>Altaf Raja</em> songs (Aawara Hawa Ka Jhonka Hoon, Tum To Thehre Pardesi). Went to drop her to station at night. Came back home and messaged some of my friends <em>Happy Holi</em>, including <em>Bajpai</em>. It was just 5-10 minutes left to 12 midnight. Hahahaaaa ha ha. Funny. Btw, I was busy whole day, so didn&rsquo;t get time to message anyone.<br>
This <em>Holi</em> was special for many reasons. <strong>Bugs</strong> showed his face. He uploaded a video on ig doing face reveal. When I saw, I started shouting and couldn&rsquo;t believe what just happened. I cann&rsquo;t express what was going inside my mind and body. You start watching some youtuber with just 1k-2k subscribers. Slowly you start falling in love with the youtuber. He makes you addicted to his videos. Everyday you check youtube to check whether he uploaded some video or not. And after 3 years, you get to see his face. Ohhhhhh. What a moment!! I started watching him from 2021. He didn&rsquo;t teach me all the linux stuff that I know right now. The credit of my linux knowledge goes to many people around the world. What <strong>Bugs</strong> did is, he inspired me to pursue linux instead of so many problems. He put fire in me for the free and open source softwares. He inspired me to have personal website. To have personal mail. He showed me the cool world of linux. He is my man. Thanks <em>bugs</em>.</p>

<p>Went to meet <em>dada-dadi</em> (grandparents). Played chess with <em>nii</em>. Watched some iit dance videos with her. Discussed about counselling procedure. Went to see moon, jupiter and venus on recommendation of <em>Patel</em>. But no luck. On east side moon was there. But on west side, no shiny object found. Maybe my timing was wrong. Applied for BARC exam. Felt good-good because of less headache.</p>

<p>Had fun with <em>nii</em>. Discussed many things. Watched dance videos together. And some funny ones too. Also showed her some cool linux scripts that I wrote. Went to meet relatives. We four played mini militia too. Obviously, I won. Commented on <em>Bajpai&rsquo;s</em> ig post. Headache is persistent. I am thinking of starting meditaion and running in morning to release some good hormones. It might help in fixing my headache. Or might not? Lets see.</p>

<p>Learnt about imagemagick commands. Wrote a script to remove exif data and then to annonate the custom date and place in the image using convert. Soon will be publishing it on my blog and github. Went to assi with <em>prateek</em>. Clicked some photos, will be posting it on my personal gallery. Headache was there. I don&rsquo;t know when my situation will improve.<br>
Btw, this same day of the last month, I called her to get the worst news. She said she doesn&rsquo;t have feelings anymore and wants breakup. The exact line were - <em>Ab wo baat nahi rahi. Ab feelings nahi rahi</em>. I was shocked.<br>
Then I contacted her close friend <em>Kumari</em> (she was her roommate in the infosys training center mysore and also her 4 year college friend), and told her the situation. Then <em>Kumari</em> said that, she(my ex) got very close to a boy named <em>Shiva Hosamani</em>. They used to have everything together. Having breakfast, lunch, dinner. Going to malls, waching movies. Playing games, cycling. Everything they used to do together. <em>Kumari</em> told me that she was her roommate just for sleeping at night, rest of the time she was with <em>Shiva Hosamani</em>. <em>Kumari</em> also said that people in the infosys training campus started questioning them, <em>&ldquo;Is there something between you both?&rdquo;</em>. Even <em>Kumari</em> asked her about her relationship with <em>Shiva Hosamani</em> and what about your relationship with <em>nikhil</em>?<br>
But no, she played very well. She didn&rsquo;t tell anyone. She kept it secret. When I called her on this day of the last month, then she tells me that she doesn&rsquo;t have feelings for me anymore. Hahahahahaaahaaa haaahaaahaa. So funny. When you do everything with a male person(<em>Shiva Hosamani</em>), eating, drinking, playing, studing, watching movies, bicycling, and many more things, then you  tell me that you don&rsquo;t have feelings for me anymore. Good game <em>Yadav</em>, good game. She used to tell me I am shatir (clever). But it turns out that she is more shatir (clever) than me.<br>
One of the reasons why Long Distance Relationships don&rsquo;t work is loyalty. People cheat in LDR. I don&rsquo;t know from where she learnt all this. Was this type of teaching given by her family, Or was it her close friends, who taught her all this? Even in my dreams, I never thought that she would cheat on me. But now its reality. Even her friends <em>Kumari</em> and <em>Srivastava</em> are like her. Are all girls like this? Is being loyal so hard in present time?<br>
Its life long lesson for me. One of the worst feeling is <em>being used as an object</em>. She used me. But I never used her. Never. But no problem. <strong>Karma</strong> is there, it will take care of everything. No one can escape Karma. And she has to pay very heavy price for what she has done. Using someone when required, and then throwing him because no use now. Its wrong. Torturing someone like this, pushing him in the deep well of depression. Its wrong. Karma will punish her. Not only her, but me too. Maybe whats happening with me is result of my bad Karma. Maybe&hellip;..</p>

<p>Less headache than yesterday, yupp its krishna&rsquo;s mercy. Had the plan of going to assi with <em>prateek</em>. But cancelled it and went to night walk nearby with him. Made idm vs aria2c meme and uploaded to reddit. The day went well. In evening headache started, and esclated slowly slowly. At night it was at its peak. Had discussion about her with <em>pradeep</em>. Told him that this is the last discussion we are having about her. I don&rsquo;t want any more bullshits. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about liers and fake people.<br>
I have come to realisation that, whatever happened cann&rsquo;t be reversed. So accept it and move on. People in this world are way too selfish. She used me. Used me for everything. And I helped her in every possible way. Now, she got someone else, so she dumped me. I was use and throw for her. Basically, I was object for her. I gave 110% of my time and energy and she didn&rsquo;t put any effort. And now she is blaming me for making the relationship toxic. And she played fake love so well that I didn&rsquo;t get any hint. She faked it for using me. She wasted my precious 1 year. Ahhhhhh cruel world!!!<br>
What I learnt from all this - there is no place for good people in this fake world. So, <em>maa chudhaye sab, humko kya</em> (Let everyone get their mothers fucked, I don&rsquo;t care anymore). Be happy yourself. Don&rsquo;t care for anyone, they have got their own hands, legs, eyes, brain,&hellip; They can take care of themself. You focus on your goal.</p>
<h3 id="-03-mar-2023-friday"># 03-Mar-2023 Friday</h3>
<p>Today it was <em>Amalaki Ekadashi</em>. So I was on fast as usual.<br>
I am in deep deep depression. I don&rsquo;t know how much time it will take for me to recover from this pain. There is nobody with whom I can share my sadness. No one will understand me. Constant headache, all day all night. Sometimes I feel like banging my head in wall. And other times I feel like cutting my skull and putting some ice inside, then stiching the skull back.<br>
Also I redesigned my website. Earlier I was using <em>gruvhugo</em> theme but now it&rsquo;s <em>charlolamode</em> theme. I am doing all this to keep myself busy. I don&rsquo;t want to remember her anymore. She has done very bad with me. Nobody in this world has the right to play with someone for fun. I repeat, nobody. Who has given you the right to play with someone&rsquo;s emotions.<br>
I hope I don&rsquo;t take any wrong steps. Krishna, please help me. This world is filled with cruel, fake and fraud people. And I don&rsquo;t want to live with them. Please give me strength Krishna.<br>
Hare krishna hare krishna, krishna krishna hare hare.<br>
Hare rama hare rama, rama rama hare hare.</p>
